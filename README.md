# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a Java-based console application that helps users discover movies based on their preferences. Users can rate and review movies, maintain a watchlist, and receive AI-inspired personalized suggestions — all using simple file storage.

## 💡 Purpose

This project solves the problem of content overload by narrowing down movie choices for users based on their tastes. It's built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, ensuring clean, reusable, and modular code.

## 🚀 Features

- User profile creation and preference storage  
- Movie rating and review system  
- Personalized movie recommendations  
- Genre and rating-based search and filter  
- Watchlist management  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: VS Code  
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit  
- **Storage**: File-based storage (text or JSON)

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with getters and setters  
- **Inheritance**: Reusable code via parent-child class structures  
- **Polymorphism**: Overloaded and overridden methods  
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes/interfaces hide implementation details

## ✅ Outcome

This project demonstrates practical application of Java OOP principles to build a working recommendation engine. It can be enhanced further with GUI or web support later on.
